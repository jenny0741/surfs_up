# Weather Analysis

## Purpose
SQLite was used to store weather data for the island of Oahu, Hawaii during the years of 2010-2017. Utilizing SQLAlchemy and Jupyter Notebook, data for the months of June and December were analyzed to determine whether a surf n’ shake shop would be sustainable year-round. Based on the results of this data, will our investor decide if they would like to invest in our shop.

## Results
1.	June stats have more observations (1,700) compared to December stats (1,517). This indicates that there is missing data for the month of December, however, this could possibly be attributed to weather conditions that made data collection impossible.
2.	The minimum temperature for December was 56F which is 8 degrees lower than the minimum for June at 64F. This would make sense as winter months would have slightly colder temperatures.
3.	Based on standard deviation and the percentile ranges of both June and December, there is little to no difference between these two months. This indicates that the weather does not fluctuate month between summer and winter months in Oahu, Hawaii.
